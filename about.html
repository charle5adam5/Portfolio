  <div id="bio">
   <p class='p'>
    I'm local to Saint Augustine, Florida and graduated from Flagler College, where
    I recieved my B.A. in 2014.
    I'm a self taught front-end developer with a passion for design. I'm continually
    pursuing my education to develop new skills and remain current in the field.
    <p class='p'>
    I was motivated to start front-end development due to my interest
    in the creative aspects of branding, marketing, and web development. Front-end development
    has allowed me to merge my interest in technology and design with a creative edge.
  </p>
   <p class='p'>
    I'm currently seeking any opportunities and always building my portfolio. 
    My Github, Codepen, and Instagram all contain some of my work so check them out on the home page!

    Thank you!
