  <div id="bio">
   <p>
    I'm local to Saint Augustine, Florida and graduated from Flagler College, where
    I recieved my B.A. in 2014.
    I'm a self taught front-end developer with a passion for design. I'm continually
    pursuing my education to develop new skills and remain current in the field.
    <p>
    I was motivated to start front-end development due to my interest
    in the creative aspects of branding, marketing, and web development. Front-end development
    has allowed me to merge my interest in technology and design with a creative edge.
  </p>
  <p>
    My other work experience includes: lab assistant, customer service, assistant manager, barista enthusiast, and precision driver. I've also been an avid follower and fan of anime culture and
    videogames since my childhood.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here on my site you can checkout my Github, Codepen, and Instagram which all contain some of my work. I'm currently seeking work opportunities to pursue my passion. Please contact me if you like my work.
