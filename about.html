  <div id="bio">
   <p class='p'>
    I'm local to Saint Augustine, Florida and graduated from Flagler College, where
    I recieved my B.A. in 2014.
    I'm a self taught front-end developer with a passion for design. I'm continually
    pursuing my education to develop new skills and remain current in the field.
    <p class='p'>
    I was motivated to start front-end development due to my interest
    in the creative aspects of branding, marketing, and web development. Front-end development
    has allowed me to merge my interest in technology and design with a creative edge.

    If you haven't, checkout my Github, Codepen, and Instagram which all contain some of my work. I'm currently seeking opportunities to pursue my passion so please feel free to contact me if you have any connections.
